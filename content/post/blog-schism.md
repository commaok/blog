Lots of people don't want to read about AI.

I respect that.

But I'm currently steeped in the world of AI, for better or for worse, and I want to blog about it. So I've split this blog in half.

The normal blog, which you are reading, is now AI-free.

There's another, at [/ai](/ai) that contains only AI posts. It has its own RSS feed.
