                    <p>When Claude writes code I don&rsquo;t like, I used to mutter: &ldquo;Oh Claude, what did you do?&rdquo; I now ask instead: &ldquo;Claude, what did you see?&rdquo; And then I go address <em>that</em>.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a concrete example.</p>
<p>At <a href="https://exe.dev">exe.dev</a>, we have a very substantial end-to-end test suite. It is deeply empiricist: It only performs actions a user (including an admin) can perform, and it only observes state that a user (including an admin) can observe. This works very well with coding agents.</p>
<p>Recently, Claude started writing end-to-end tests that reach into the database. At first, I told Claude not to do that, and it fixed it. Then I got smart. I asked Claude what tests it had modeled its new code on. Sure enough, they were also directly executing queries! Claude wasn&rsquo;t being sloppy; it was being consistent. I fixed the old tests and shut down the loophole in the test infrastructure.</p>
<p>My typical prompt to a coding agent is a few sentences. Maybe a couple of paragraphs, if I&rsquo;m doing something really involved. The LLM then goes and reads thousands of lines or more from our codebase. Prompts come and go; your code endures.</p>
<p>Agents mirror local style. Your codebase is the prompt. If you&rsquo;re using a state-of-the-art agent, and you don&rsquo;t like the code it generates, don&rsquo;t correct the agent. Instead, improve the code it learned from.</p>
