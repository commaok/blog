<p>Some build tools are noisy. (Yes, I&rsquo;m looking at you, <code>xcodebuild</code>.)</p>
<p>We <em>want</em> our agents to re-build our projects regularly&hellip;but not at the cost of destroying their context window.</p>
<p>So I had an agent write a tiny shell script wrapper that strips away <em>everything but the error messages</em> when builds fail. Successful build output is merely: &ldquo;Build succeeded&rdquo;. It uses some awful regexps that only an LLM would write&hellip;but it&rsquo;s fast and it works.</p>
<p>My token use instantly dropped and the agent got more noticeably effective. And it turns out I prefer it too.</p>
<p>This is not new! The Unix philosophy says that when a program has nothing to report, it should remain silent.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.catb.org/esr/writings/taoup/html/ch01s06.html#id2878450">ESR&rsquo;s comment</a> on this rule is spot-on for both humans and LLMs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Well-designed programs treat the user&rsquo;s attention and concentration as a precious and limited resource, only to be claimed when necessary.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If your agent runs a build tool that wasn&rsquo;t designed by Rob Pike, invest in a dedicated wrapper to trim its output.</p>
<h3 id="prime-the-pump">Prime the pump</h3>
<p>Even frontier models don&rsquo;t always listen, particularly if there are several important rules, and some of those rules fly in the face of their instincts (no mocks! use elemwise comparisons, not summary statistics!).</p>
<p>One way to drive a set of rules home is to ask the agent to start by looking for <em>violations of those rules</em>, knowing it won&rsquo;t find any. That fills the context window with a bunch of text about those rules, in effect showing&ndash;instead of telling&ndash;the agent what (not) to do.</p>
<p>This burns useful context window, but it significantly improves compliance. Sometimes this is a worthwhile trade-off. In constrast, I have found the opposite approach (wait for an agent to violate a rule, then ask it to self-correct) to be completely ineffective.</p>
