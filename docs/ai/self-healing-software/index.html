                    <p>Traditional software is <a href="https://commaok.xyz/ai/is-claude-a-compiler/">repeatable</a>, fast, and efficient, but brittle.</p>
<p>LLM agents are flexible, but <a href="https://www.dbreunig.com/2025/12/06/the-state-of-agents.html">unreliable</a>, slow, and inefficient.</p>
<p>I have started using a hybrid model, <em>self-healing software</em>: traditional software whose failures trigger coding agent intervention. The agent examines what went wrong, edits the software until it works again, and retries. [1]</p>
<p>Weirdly, for self-healing software, brittleness is a feature. The resiliency comes from the agent. You <em>want</em> their judgment involved when conditions change. Make lots of assertions, accept no fallbacks.</p>
<p>(All of this obviously has serious prompt injection problems! As always, consider the provenance of your inputs and the blast radius of failures.)</p>
<p>To make this more concrete, here&rsquo;s a recent example.</p>
<p>I wanted to scrape my kids&rsquo; report cards from their school&rsquo;s website. I trust the website, but it is unstable, unpleasant to use, and has no API.</p>
<p>I started an <a href="https://exe.dev">exe.dev</a> VM for isolation and set up a cron that runs a shell script:</p>
<ul>
<li>start a headless browser</li>
<li>run a series of Playwright scripts</li>
<li>on success, send me the results</li>
<li>on error, invoke yolo claude with the error log and the goals</li>
</ul>
<p>Normal runs are fast and effective. When something goes wrong, Claude patiently struggles with query selectors and screenshots until it works again, and commits the changes. I remain blissfully unaware.</p>
<p>[1] This sounds superficially similar to the <a href="https://ghuntley.com/ralph/">Ralph Wiggum</a> approach to software. But here, the agent is mostly dormant: it only engages when something goes wrong, which means that most runs go smoothly. And the self-healing component can be scoped more narrowly to fit as a smaller piece of a larger project.</p>
