                    <p>I didn&rsquo;t plan to write software in the grocery store last night.</p>
<p>I was tired and hungry, kids in tow. My long shopping list sat in a text message. I wished I could check items off as I found them. Ideas filtered through my head:</p>
<ul>
<li>I could transfer the list to a piece of paper: too tedious</li>
<li>I could copy/paste it into a notes app or an email draft and delete items: too much tapping</li>
<li>I could search the web and app store for a thing that would do what I want (of which there were no doubt a great many): slow and painful and annoying</li>
</ul>
<p>Nope nope nope nope nope.</p>
<p>Instead, I skulked over to a corner of the produce section, opened up <a href="https://exe.dev">exe.dev</a>, tapped &ldquo;New&rdquo; to spin up a VM, put on my best &ldquo;crazy person talking to himself&rdquo; face, and dictated into my phone:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Please make me a simple shopping list app. Here’s how it works. I can paste in the shopping list freeform, it splits it up into separate items then I can quickly tap a checkbox next to an item to strike it through. That’s it. All state is persisted entirely on the client.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Two minutes later, over in dairy, I pulled my phone back out; the site was ready. I copy/pasted in the text message. It worked. I checked off some items and kept shopping.</p>
<p>After grabbing some pasta, I got annoyed that I had to scroll up and down to see the items I was still missing. I hate UIs that move elements around on me, but still. I pulled up Shelley (the exe.dev per-VM coding agent) and dictated again:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Please add a button that I can click to sort the completed items to the bottom of the list I don&rsquo;t want it to do this automatically because I want UI stability but I do want the option to say OK please go ahead and do the appropriate sorting don&rsquo;t filter them away don&rsquo;t get rid of them just sort them to the bottom</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I returned to shopping. A minute later, a &ldquo;Sort Completed to Bottom&rdquo; button appeared. I tapped it. It worked. I finished shopping.</p>
<h3 id="creating-is-faster-than-searching">Creating is faster than searching</h3>
<p>My <a href="https://shopping.exe.xyz">ad hoc shopping app</a> is not exactly groundbreaking. What&rsquo;s interesting is that I could summon exactly what I wanted into existence faster and with much less effort than finding a pre-built solution&hellip;or than doing my task without software, which is my usual go-to approach.</p>
<p>Many years ago, we visited a friend&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s house over Christmas. We decided to make cookies to use up a big bowl of hazelnuts. There was only one problem. My friend&rsquo;s mother wandered around the house muttering &ldquo;nutcracker, nutcracker, nutcracker&rdquo;. The house was built in the late 1700s and had spent the intervening centuries accumulating stuff. I read the writing on the wall and popped over to the nearest store and bought us a simple metal nutcracker.</p>
<p>Hours later, the nuts shelled, the cookies baked and eaten, my friend&rsquo;s mother yelled in delight: &ldquo;I found it! The nutcracker drawer!&rdquo; Yes, she had an entire drawer full of nutcrackers. In went the latest addition.</p>
<p>The internet is a giant colonial New England house, its innumerable drawers stuffed with things far weirder than nutcrackers.</p>
<p>If your needs are simple and easily explained, you are now best served by describing into existence the exact tool you want, at the moment you want it.</p>
<h3 id="disposable-software">Disposable software</h3>
<p>There&rsquo;s a part of me that recoils in horror at the idea of single-use software. Disposable anything feels wasteful.</p>
<p>I knew someone who found that it was about the same price to buy new t-shirts as to wash the ones they had, so they filled landfills rather than walk to the laundromat. Ugghhh.</p>
<p>So I sat down today and did some rough order-of-magnitude calculations. The tokens used to build my website cost $0.34. (Or they would have if they were <em>a la carte</em>; exe.dev includes some free tokens.) That probably translates to about 5g of CO₂e, or driving a gas car some 75 feet. This feels acceptable to me.</p>
<p>The only other scarce resource consumed is the name <code>shopping.exe.xyz</code>. Oh well.</p>
<p>Also, I was using Claude Opus 4.5, the top of the line coding model, which was definitely overkill. And models are rapidly getting cheaper and more energy efficient.</p>
<p>Waste is waste, but also, hoarding is hoarding. Just in time software, written in the moment to match your needs, is the future.</p>
