<p>The <a href="http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html">Bitter Lesson</a> is, as-written, about AI. It begins:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The biggest lesson that can be read from 70 years of AI research is [&hellip;]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But the end of that sentence is far more broadly applicable than just AI. It continues:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>that general methods that leverage computation are ultimately the most effective, and by a large margin.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even without billions of dollars of GPUs, and even without being able to utilize arbitrary amounts of compute, the ability to leverage computational power is phenomenally useful.</p>
<p>Differential testing and fuzz testing are prime examples. (Formal methods and theorem solvers too.) Differential techniques have many flavors, such as <a href="https://research.swtch.com/diffcover">differential coverage</a>. One lesser-known one is <em>differential spec analysis</em>.</p>
<p>In differential spec analysis, you write multiple implementations from a spec and then compare their behavior. It is most powerful when paired with fuzzing, but as we&rsquo;ll see, it even works without fuzzing.</p>
<p>Once any harness bugs have been resolved, deviations in behavior fall into two categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>implementation bugs, in which case your spec likely needs more unit tests or details</li>
<li>ambiguity, in which case your spec is under-specified</li>
</ul>
<p>Both outcomes teach you useful things about your spec, without ever looking at a single line of code, in any language.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a worked example.</p>
<p>Drew Breunig recently published <a href="https://github.com/dbreunig/whenwords">whenwords</a>, which is a fun exploration of a <a href="https://www.dbreunig.com/2026/01/08/a-software-library-with-no-code.html">codeless open source repo</a>. The idea is that agents are now so good that publishing an excellent spec is sufficient to have top quality implementations on demand in any language you want.</p>
<p>A codeless repo is the perfect opportunity to try out differential spec analysis!</p>
<p>I cloned whenwords and asked Opus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Please write implementations of this in a half dozen languages, including Go. Prefer languages I already have installed on this machine. Use subagents for each language, and DO NOT LET THEM LOOK AT THE OTHER IMPLEMENTATIONS. I want each implementation to be de-novo. Then, using <a href="https://github.com/dvyukov/go-fuzz">https://github.com/dvyukov/go-fuzz</a>, write differential fuzz tests that invoke all the different implementations. Investigate any deviation between implementations. Note <em>all</em> deviations. Deviations that are &ldquo;just bugs&rdquo; would be useful to add to the acceptance tests. Deviations that aren&rsquo;t &ldquo;just bugs&rdquo; but are instead differing reasonable interpretations of the spec would be useful to clarify in the spec. Keep a running document on disk of both kinds of failures.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sadly, it didn&rsquo;t end up using fuzz testing, choosing instead to hand-roll the test suites, but it nevertheless came back with some interesting material.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t quite finish the analysis, though, so I followed up with:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>So for the bugs, were there existing unit tests in tests.yaml that the sub-agents simply missed, or does it need new unit tests added? If the latter, please add them.</p>
<p>For the ambiguities&hellip;please re-read the spec and triple-check that the spec is actually ambiguous about this. If it isn&rsquo;t ambiguous, then it&rsquo;s a bug, in which case, see the prior question (just a bug or a missing tests.yaml case?). If actually ambiguous, please make a judgment call about the best behavior and add it to the spec and also add &ldquo;just enough&rdquo; tests.yaml cases to cover it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what it found.</p>
<p>There were missing test cases around zero durations, which manifested as Swift crashes. Opus added these test cases:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>  - name: &#34;zero seconds&#34;
    input: &#34;0s&#34;
    output: 0

  - name: &#34;zero hours and minutes&#34;
    input: &#34;0h 0m&#34;
    output: 0
</code></pre><p>There were missing test cases around month rounding, which manifested as incorrect Go outputs. Opus added:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>  - name: &#34;8 months ago - 229 days (tests rounding)&#34;
    input: { timestamp: 1684281600, reference: 1704067200 }
    output: &#34;8 months ago&#34;
</code></pre><p>And there was an ambiguity in the spec about what to do with non-integer inputs to duration.</p>
<p>Opus suggested specifying rounding thus:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>### Fractional input handling

When `duration()` receives a non-integer seconds value, first round to the nearest whole second using half-up rounding before decomposing into units. Examples:
- `duration(59.4)` → &#34;59 seconds&#34; (rounds to 59)
- `duration(59.5)` → &#34;1 minute&#34; (rounds to 60 seconds = 1 minute)
- `duration(0.4)` → &#34;0 seconds&#34; (rounds to 0)
</code></pre><p>With corresponding test cases:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>  - name: &#34;fractional - rounds down&#34;
    input: { seconds: 59.4 }
    output: &#34;59 seconds&#34;

  - name: &#34;fractional - rounds up to minute&#34;
    input: { seconds: 59.5 }
    output: &#34;1 minute&#34;

  - name: &#34;fractional - rounds to zero&#34;
    input: { seconds: 0.4 }
    output: &#34;0 seconds&#34;
</code></pre><p>There are limitations. If your spec is clear but encodes the wrong decisions, differential spec analysis won&rsquo;t help.</p>
