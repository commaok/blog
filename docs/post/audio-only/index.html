                    <p>Whenever possible, I leave my webcam off during internet meetings. It is almost always possible.</p>
<p>There are a few reasons. In decreasing importance:</p>
<h2 id="attention">Attention</h2>
<p>Screens are attention-destroyers.</p>
<p>There are so many things to look at and to do. I was probably deep into a task when the meeting started. So tempting to just nudge it along. Or I might stare at myself on camera.</p>
<p>If I turn the webcam off, I can stand up and move around.</p>
<p>The impact of this on my attention is <em>dramatic</em>.</p>
<p>People sometimes think that I&rsquo;ve turned off my camera so that I can tune out. This has it exactly backwards. If my camera is on, I&rsquo;m probably not paying much attention.</p>
<p>As a bonus, I get fresh air, exercise, a tidier house, or fewer weeds in my garden.</p>
<h2 id="fatigue">Fatigue</h2>
<p>Being on-camera is tiring; it&rsquo;s well-documented. I have yet to see benefits from video that outweigh that cost.</p>
<h2 id="connection-quality">Connection quality</h2>
<p>Except for the very best of internet connections, audio-only just works better.</p>
<p>Fluid conversation consists of <a href="https://chelseatroy.com/2018/03/29/why-do-remote-meetings-suck-so-much/">continuous negotiation about turn-taking</a>. Every negotiation is a round trip; high latency destroys easy communication.</p>
<p>Humans also handle audio hiccups better than video artifacts, perhaps because we&rsquo;re accustomed to acoustic interference in the real world. Wind happens, but a frozen, pixelated face is unnerving.</p>
<h2 id="formality">Formality</h2>
<p>I don&rsquo;t FaceTime my family or close friends. We talk on the phone. It&rsquo;s relaxing and pleasant. Video calls feel formal and stiff.</p>
<p>And in fact, the main scenario in which I find it socially difficult to turn off my video camera is in formal calls, usually with people I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Increasingly, though, I establish from the moment that the call is scheduled that my camera will be off. Any awkwardness from that has faded by the time the call occurs. And I&rsquo;m happier for it.</p>
