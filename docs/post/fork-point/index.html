<p>This is a git <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/ExperienceReports">experience report</a> based on something that bit me hard today, despite being quite experienced with git. Play along!</p>
<h1 id="prologue">Prologue</h1>
<p>Initialize a repo. Create two commits.</p>
<pre><code>$ git init .
Initialized empty Git repository in &lt;redacted&gt;

$ touch readme
$ git add readme
$ git commit -a -m &quot;initial commit&quot;
[main (root-commit) ac2d8e7] initial commit
 1 file changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
 create mode 100644 readme

$ touch readme.2
$ git add readme.2
$ git commit -a -m &quot;another commit&quot;
[main fb0f7fe] another commit
 1 file changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
 create mode 100644 readme.2
</code></pre><p>So far, pretty mundane. Here's what the repo looks like:</p>
<pre><code>$ git log --all --decorate --oneline --graph
* fb0f7fe (HEAD -&gt; main) another commit
* ac2d8e7 initial commit
</code></pre><h1 id="oops">Oops</h1>
<p>I meant to create <code>readme.2</code> on a branch. No problem. Let's create that branch now.</p>
<pre><code>$ git checkout -b branch
Branch 'branch' set up to track local branch 'main' by rebasing.
Switched to a new branch 'branch'
</code></pre><p>Oh, and better put <code>main</code> back where it belongs.</p>
<pre><code>$ git checkout main
Switched to branch 'main'
$ git reset --hard HEAD~1
HEAD is now at ac2d8e7 initial commit
</code></pre><p>Now the repo looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>$ git log --all --decorate --oneline --graph
* 95cc2c0 (branch) another commit
* 20a231b (HEAD -&gt; main) initial commit
</code></pre><h1 id="bug-fix">Bug fix</h1>
<p>Let's fix a bug on main.</p>
<pre><code>$ echo &quot;nothing to see here&quot; &gt; readme
$ git commit -a -m &quot;fill out the readme&quot;
[main eebece5] fill out the readme
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
</code></pre><p>Now <code>main</code> and <code>branch</code> have diverged a bit.</p>
<pre><code>$ git log --all --decorate --oneline --graph
* eebece5 (HEAD -&gt; main) fill out the readme
| * fb0f7fe (branch) another commit
|/  
* ac2d8e7 initial commit
</code></pre><h1 id="time-to-rebase">Time to rebase</h1>
<p>Let's get <code>branch</code> rebased onto <code>main</code>.</p>
<pre><code>$ git checkout branch
Switched to branch 'branch'
Your branch and 'main' have diverged,
and have 1 and 1 different commits each, respectively.
  (use &quot;git pull&quot; to merge the remote branch into yours)
</code></pre><p>Before reading any further, stop. Summon your git fu. What will happen when we run <code>git rebase</code>?</p>
<p>If you're like me, you expect something like this:</p>
<pre><code>* 7a8805e (HEAD -&gt; branch) another commit
* eebece5 (main) fill out the readme
* ac2d8e7 initial commit
</code></pre><p>Three commits. <code>branch</code> has been rebased on top of <code>main</code>, so it is one commit ahead of it.</p>
<p>OK, let's find out what really happens.</p>
<pre><code>$ git rebase
Successfully rebased and updated refs/heads/branch.
</code></pre><p>Moment of truth.</p>
<pre><code>$ git log --all --decorate --oneline --graph
* eebece5 (HEAD -&gt; branch, main) fill out the readme
* ac2d8e7 initial commit
</code></pre><p>There are only two commits. <code>branch</code> and <code>main</code> are on the same commit.</p>
<p>What happened to the third commit? It's gone.</p>
<h1 id="denouement">Denouement</h1>
<p>What happened was <code>--fork-point</code>.</p>
<p>The first step to a rebase (and many other operations) is to find a <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-merge-base">merge base</a>. This is some shared commit in history, common ground from which to trace divergent paths.</p>
<p>The most obvious way to find a merge base is by looking at the graph for the most recent commit reachable by everyone.</p>
<p>But inspecting the graph doesn't always get you the ideal result. What if you intentionally abandoned some commits on <code>main</code>? Looking just at the graph to find the merge base might accidentally resuscitate them. There's a <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-merge-base#_discussion_on_fork_point_mode">fully worked example</a> in the git docs.</p>
<p>The <code>--fork-point</code> flag is a clever attempt to work around this. <code>git rebase</code> describes it thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Use reflog to find a better common ancestor between <code>upstream</code> and <code>branch</code> when calculating which commits have been introduced by <code>branch</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-reflog">git reflog</a> is a log of changes made to git refs. (If you don't know what a &ldquo;ref&rdquo; is, substitute the word &ldquo;branch&rdquo;.) It's meta version control. It tracks what you did with your version control over time.</p>
<p>The reflog is quite useful if you make a horrible mistake. You can poke through the reflog to find a lost commit.</p>
<p><code>--fork-point</code> looks through the <em>temporal history of your git repo</em> to pick a merge base, &ldquo;allowing you to replay only the commits on your topic, excluding the commits the other side later discarded.&rdquo; In this context, &ldquo;later&rdquo; really means later in time, not &ldquo;descendent of&rdquo; in abstract git graph world.</p>
<p>And here we have the explanation for what happened. I discovered I had committed on <code>main</code> by accident, and <em>reset <code>main</code> to the previous commit</em>. From <code>--fork-point</code>'s perspective, the <code>main</code> branch had <em>discarded</em> the commit on <code>branch</code>. Therefore it was not included when we selected a merge base to rebase <code>branch</code> onto <code>main</code>.</p>
<h1 id="whats-wrong-here">What's wrong here?</h1>
<p>To my mind, two things went wrong here.</p>
<p><code>--fork-point</code> assumes that discarded commits were discarded <em>because they were unwanted</em>. But that is not always true. In my case, they were discarded because they were unwanted <em>at that moment</em>. Adding more clever heuristics might help some here, but I suspect it's impossible to infer intent, which is what is required.</p>
<p>The bigger issue is that the behavior of <code>git rebase</code> now depends on (almost) invisible, inscrutable state. The ability to mentally model what a command will do is critical to being able to use any tool. It's pretty easy to view a git graph; it is the default view for most git UIs. And it's not too hard as a human to pick out the topological merge base from there. The reflog is all but invisible. And it is definitely not easy for a human to process.</p>
<h1 id="the-fix">The fix</h1>
<p>The solution is obviously more flags. My git config's <code>[alias]</code> section now includes <code>r = rebase --no-fork-point</code>.</p>
